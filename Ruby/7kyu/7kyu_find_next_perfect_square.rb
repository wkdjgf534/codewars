# You might know some pretty large perfect squares. But what about the NEXT one?
# Complete the findNextSquare method that finds the next integral perfect square
# after the one passed as a parameter. Recall that an integral perfect square is an
# integer n such that sqrt(n) is also an integer.
# If the parameter is itself not a perfect square, than -1 should be returned.
#  You may assume the parameter is positive.

# Examples:
# find_next_square(121) -> 144
# find_next_square(625) -> 676
# find_next_square(114) -> -1 since 114 is not a perfect
